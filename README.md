# Email Spam Classification Model

This project builds a **machine learning model** to predict whether an email is *spam* or *not spam* based on its content.  
Using text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms, the model demonstrates how natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to real-world email data.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:
- Clean and preprocess raw email text data.
- Convert textual information into numerical features using **TF-IDF vectorization**.
- Train and evaluate multiple machine learning models to classify emails as spam or not spam.
- Analyze performance through key metrics and visualizations.

## Key Features
- **Text Preprocessing:** tokenization, stop-word removal, and vectorization.  
- **Machine Learning Models:** Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Random Forest.  
- **Model Evaluation:** accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrices.  
- **Visualization:** Seaborn plots for model performance comparison.

---

## Tech Stack
**Languages:** Python  
**Libraries:** Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
**Tools:** Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Results
- Achieved **89% accuracy** on the test set (replace with your actual result).  
- Visual analysis revealed strong separation between spam and non-spam clusters after TF-IDF transformation.

## Dataset
This project uses a publicly available spam dataset from spam assasin https://spamassassin.apache.org/old/publiccorpus/
